== Scoring Goals
A team scores a goal when the ball fully enters the opponent goal between the goal posts,
provided that:

* The team did not exceed the allowed number of robots when the ball entered the goal.
* The height of the ball did not exceed 0.15 meters after the last touch of the teams robots.
* The team did not commit any rule infringements since the teams robots last touched the ball.

NOTE: During <<Penalty Kick, penalty kicks>>, more specific rules apply.

If the goal is considered invalid, the game will be continued as if the ball crossed the goal line outside the goal.
