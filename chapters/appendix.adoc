== Terminology
=== Ball In And Out Of Play
When the match is <<Stopping The Game, stopped>>, the ball is considered *out of play* until it has been brought into play.

When the match is <<Resuming The Game, resumed>>, the ball is considered *in play* until the next stoppage occurs. The match is resumed when <<Force Start, force start>> has been issued or the ball moved at least 0.05 meters following a <<Kick-Off, kick-off>>, <<Free Kick, free kick>> or <<Penalty Kick, penalty kick>>.

NOTE: see <<Double Touch, double touch>> for the rationale of the 0.05 meter distance

* The automatic <<Ball Placement, ball placement>> procedure is mandatory for division A and optional for division B.
* The <<Aimless Kick [small]#(_division B only_)#, aimless kick>> rule only applies to division B.
* There is a smaller time window in division A for taking a free kick before <<Lack Of Progress, lack of progress>> is called.
* Division A has a shorter <<Lack Of Progress, lack of progress>> timeout in some situations
