* Division A plays on a <<Dimensions, larger field>> with <<Goals, larger goals>> than division B. As a result, a <<Penalty Kick, penalty kick>> is taken from a greater distance as well.
* Division A plays with <<Number Of Robots, more robots>> than division B.
* The automatic <<Ball Placement, ball placement>> procedure is mandatory for division A and optional for division B.
* The <<aimless-kick, aimless kick>> rule only applies to division B.
* Division A has shorter timeouts in some situations.
* <<Emergency stop>> only applies to division A.
