== Emergency stop

This rule only applies to Division A.

.Definition
A team can ask to stop the game immediately after a grace period of 10 seconds or at the next stoppage, whichever happens first regardless of the current situation.
It will receive a yellow card for this and must take a timeout immediately.
If the team is out of timeouts, it is still allowed to remove robots from the field, but can not use any remaining timeout time.

NOTE: This rule is supposed to be used in extreme situations only, e.g. a software crash or when robots are damaging themselves significantly.

When the game is stopped due to this rule, there are three possibilities that may have happened:

. The grace period has passed and the game is stopped.
. The human referee stopped the game earlier.
. The game is stopped earlier due to the ball leaving the field or because of a foul.

For these possibilities there are two methods to proceed the game:

. For *1* and *2*, the game is continued with a <<Free Kick, free kick>> for the opposing team.
. For *3*, the game is continued like after a regular timeout.

.Usage
An emergency stop intent can be made using <<Communication Flags, communication flags>>.

NOTE: The referee may stop the game earlier if there is no promising play in action.
