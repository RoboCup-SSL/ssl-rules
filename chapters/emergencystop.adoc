== Emergency stop

This rule only applies to Division A.

.Definition

A team can ask to stop the game immediately after a grace period of 10 seconds or at the next stoppage, whichever happens first regardless of the current situation. It will receive a yellow card for this and must take a timeout immediately. If the team is out of timeouts, it is still allowed to remove robots from the field, but can not use any remaining timeout time.

.Usage

A emergency stop intent can be made by:

. A <<Robot Handler, robot handler>> by informing the <<Game Controller Operator, game controller operator>> who in turn enters the intent into the <<Game Controller, game controller>>.
