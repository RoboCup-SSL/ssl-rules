== Rule Changes During Competition

Rule changes between years can have unforeseen consequences.
If a rule is found to cause significant negative impact to the competition, the rules may be adapted under the following conditions:

* Only between phases of the competition, like round-robin and knockout
* Only for major problems, as a last resort
* The change must be approved by all team leaders (by an unanimity vote)
