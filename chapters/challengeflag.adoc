== Challenge Flag

In American football there is a challenge flag. A team can challenge a decision of the referee:

. If referees decision was correct, team loses a timeout.
. If referees decision was incorrect, the correct decision is applied and the team doesn't lose a timeout.

NOTE: In both cases the team loses one flag.

Only one ruling may be challenged at a time.

Each team will receive two flags at the start of the game.
