== Challenge Flag

A challenge flag allows teams to challenge a decision of the referee:

. If referees decision was correct, team loses a timeout.
. If referees decision was incorrect, the correct decision is applied and the team doesn't lose a timeout.

NOTE: The flag is consumed in both cases.

Only one ruling may be challenged at a time.

The team must have at least one timeout left before using a challenge flag.

Each team will receive *three flags* at the start of the game.

NOTE: This rule is inspired by challenge flags in American football.
